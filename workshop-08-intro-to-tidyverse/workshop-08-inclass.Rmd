## welcome to workshop-08
Today we will be covering the following topics:
- Github and Git
- Intro to tidyverse
  - tidy evaluation and metaprogramming
  - data frames and data masking, and why I didn't teach tidyverse first when we learned R
  - dplyr
  - brief discussion about other tidyverse libraries that might be of use (stringr, tidyr, plyr)
  - ggplot2 (if time permits)
